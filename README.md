`/app/globals.css`: Contains some custom styling for the overall app.
`/app/layout.jsx`: Contains the meta data, font styles and overall layout.
`/components`: contains different reusable components.
`hooks`: Has a custom built react hook useDebounce to delay search results.
`/utils/js`: contains the data for weather icons imported from react-icons 

## Journey
